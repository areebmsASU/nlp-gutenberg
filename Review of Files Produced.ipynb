       " '      most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their neighbours in',\n",
       " '      agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they are commonly more',\n",

       " '      bestowed upon them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural',\n",
       " '      fertility of the ground. But this superiority of produce is seldom much',\n",
       " '      more than in proportion to the superiority of labour and expense. In',\n",
       " '      agriculture, the labour of the rich country is not always much more',\n",

       " '      productive, as it commonly is in manufactures. The corn of the rich',\n",
       " '      country, therefore, will not always, in the same degree of goodness, come',\n",
       " '      cheaper to market than that of the poor. The corn of Poland, in the same',\n",
       " '      degree of goodness, is as cheap as that of France, notwithstanding the',\n",

       " '      corn-lands of France are said to be much better cultivated than those of',\n",

       " '      manufactures, at least if those manufactures suit the soil, climate, and',\n",
       " '      situation, of the rich country. The silks of France are better and cheaper',\n",
       " '      than those of England, because the silk manufacture, at least under the',\n",

       " '      is owing to three different circumstances; first, to the increase of',\n",
       " '      dexterity in every particular workman; secondly, to the saving of the time',\n",
       " '      which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another;',\n",
       " '      and, lastly, to the invention of a great number of machines which',\n",
       " '      facilitate and abridge labour, and enable one man to do the work of many.',\n",
       " '    ',\n",
       " '      First, the improvement of the dexterity of the workmen, necessarily',\n",
       " '      increases the quantity of the work he can perform; and the division of',\n",
       " '      labour, by reducing every man’s business to some one simple operation, and',\n",
       " '      by making this operation the sole employment of his life, necessarily',\n",
       " '      increases very much the dexterity of the workman. A common smith, who,',\n",
       " '      though accustomed to handle the hammer, has never been used to make nails,',\n",
       " '      if, upon some particular occasion, he is obliged to attempt it, will',\n",
       " '      scarce, I am assured, be able to make above two or three hundred nails in',\n",
       " '      a day, and those, too, very bad ones. A smith who has been accustomed to',\n",
       " '      make nails, but whose sole or principal business has not been that of a',\n",
       " '      nailer, can seldom, with his utmost diligence, make more than eight',\n",
       " '      hundred or a thousand nails in a day. I have seen several boys, under',\n",
       " '      twenty years of age, who had never exercised any other trade but that of',\n",
       " '      making nails, and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each of',\n",
       " '      them, upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day. The making of',\n",
       " '      a nail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The same',\n",
       " '      person blows the bellows, stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion,',\n",
       " '      heats the iron, and forges every part of the nail: in forging the head,',\n",
       " '      too, he is obliged to change his tools. The different operations into',\n",
       " '      which the making of a pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of',\n",
       " '      them much more simple, and the dexterity of the person, of whose life it',\n",
       " '      has been the sole business to perform them, is usually much greater. The',\n",
       " '      rapidity with which some of the operations of those manufactures are',\n",
       " '      performed, exceeds what the human hand could, by those who had never seen',\n",
       " '      them, be supposed capable of acquiring.',\n",
       " '    ',\n",
       " '      Secondly, the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost',\n",
       " '      in passing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we',\n",
       " '      should at first view be apt to imagine it. It is impossible to pass very',\n",
       " '      quickly from one kind of work to another, that is carried on in a',\n",
       " '      different place, and with quite different tools. A country weaver, who',\n",
       " '      cultivates a small farm, must lose a good deal of time in passing from',\n",
       " '      his loom to the field, and from the field to his loom. When the two trades',\n",
       " '      can be carried on in the same workhouse, the loss of time is, no doubt,',\n",
       " '      much less. It is, even in this case, however, very considerable. A man',\n",
       " '      commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment',\n",
       " '      to another. When he first begins the new work, he is seldom very keen and',\n",
       " '      hearty; his mind, as they say, does not go to it, and for some time he',\n",
       " '      rather trifles than applies to good purpose. The habit of sauntering, and',\n",
       " '      of indolent careless application, which is naturally, or rather',\n",
       " '      necessarily, acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change',\n",
       " '      his work and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in twenty',\n",
       " '      different ways almost every day of his life, renders him almost always',\n",
       " '      slothful and lazy, and incapable of any vigorous application, even on the',\n",
       " '      most pressing occasions. Independent, therefore, of his deficiency in',\n",
       " '      point of dexterity, this cause alone must always reduce considerably the',\n",
       " '      quantity of work which he is capable of performing.',\n",
       " '    ',\n",
       " '      Thirdly, and lastly, everybody must be sensible how much labour is',\n",
       " '      facilitated and abridged by the application of proper machinery. It is',\n",
       " '      unnecessary to give any example. I shall only observe, therefore, that the',\n",
       " '      invention of all those machines by which labour is so much facilitated and',\n",
       " '      abridged, seems to have been originally owing to the division of labour.',\n",

       " '      attaining any object, when the whole attention of their minds is directed',\n",
       " '      towards that single object, than when it is dissipated among a great',\n",
       " '      variety of things. But, in consequence of the division of labour, the',\n",
       " '      whole of every man’s attention comes naturally to be directed towards some',\n",
       " '      one very simple object. It is naturally to be expected, therefore, that',\n",
       " '      some one or other of those who are employed in each particular branch of',\n",
       " '      labour should soon find out easier and readier methods of performing their',\n",
       " '      own particular work, whenever the nature of it admits of such improvement.',\n",
       " '      A great part of the machines made use of in those manufactures in which',\n",
       " '      labour is most subdivided, were originally the invention of common',\n",
       " '      workmen, who, being each of them employed in some very simple operation,',\n",
       " '      naturally turned their thoughts towards finding out easier and readier',\n",
       " '      methods of performing it. Whoever has been much accustomed to visit such',\n",
       " '      manufactures, must frequently have been shewn very pretty machines, which',\n",
       " '      were the inventions of such workmen, in order to facilitate and quicken',\n",
       " '      their own particular part of the work. In the first fire engines {this was',\n",
       " '      the current designation for steam engines}, a boy was constantly employed',\n",
       " '      to open and shut alternately the communication between the boiler and the',\n",

       " '      All the improvements in machinery, however, have by no means been the',\n",
       " '      inventions of those who had occasion to use the machines. Many',\n",
       " '      improvements have been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the',\n",
       " '      machines, when to make them became the business of a peculiar trade; and',\n",
